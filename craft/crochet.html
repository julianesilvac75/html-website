        <h1>CROCHET</h1>
        <p>I learned the basics of crochet with my mom when I was a kid, so this type of work has a very special meaning to me. Crocheting is easy and fast, which makes it a great technic for people who don't like to spend days in one single project; you can get a small work done in hours and then jump right off to another new project in the same day.</p>
        <p>I like crocheting accessories like hats, scarfs and socks, but my favorite technic is called <strong>amigurumi</strong>, which is the japanese art of crocheting stuffed creatures like animals, people or even objects. Here are 3 of my favorite works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Alice in Wonderland Collection</h4>
                <img src="../images/alice-in-wonderland.jpg" height="250" alt="Characters from the story 'Alice in Wonderland': Mad Hatter, Red Queen, Cheshire Cat, Alice and White Rabbit; Ace of Hearts card and Pocket Clock key rings; All pieces crocheted with yarn">
                <p>My favorite work by far. Each toy takes approximately 6 to 7 hours to make.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Detective Pikachu</h4>
                <img src="../images/pikachu.jpg" height="250" alt="Crocheted character from the movie 'Detective Pikachu', with a pokeball on the background; Both pieces crocheted with yarn">
                <p>This was the first amigurumi I made and it took me some days to finish because I was still learning the technic.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Personalized Voodoo-doll</h4>
                <img src="../images/voodoo-doll.jpg" height="250" alt="Personalized voodoo-doll with some pins on the body and a key ring on the left leg; Crocheted with yarn">
                <p>This is a very simple project to make, but it took me some extra hours because, unlike the other ones, I didn't have a pattern to follow, so I had to write the pattern myself.</p>
