        <h1>KNITTING</h1>
        <p>
            I learned how to knit during the fist months 
            of lockdown due the COVID-19 pandemic, and this 
            was something very important for me to keep going 
            during that difficult time. Since then, I've never 
            stopped learning; knitting is hard and takes a 
            long time, and there are so much techniques that 
            you could spend a whole life learning, which I think is awesome.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite projects are the ones that have a 
            lot of different stitches, because they make 
            the work very dynamic. Since some pieces can 
            take weeks or even months to be done, it's important 
            for me to have a dynamic pattern, otherwise I get bored.

        <p>Here are the top 3 favorite projects I've made:</p>

                <h4>Candy Beanie</h4>

                    This was a gift for my niece, and it was 
                    a fun project because it was the first time 
                    I worked with a circular needle instead of 
                    two flat needles.

                <h4>Ocean Scarf</h4>
                <img
                    src="../images/scarf.jpg"
                    height="250"

                >
                <p>
                    I love giving knitted gits, and this scarf 
                    was a present for my sister. It was knitted 
                    with two needles with different sizes each, 
                    which is a unusual technic.

                <h4>Autumn Jumper</h4>
                <img
                    src="../images/jumper.jpg"
                    height="250"

                <p>
                    This was by far the biggest project I've made, and 
                    it took me over 40 hours to finish - at some point, 
                    I just stopped timing. But it was so worth it, because 
                    wearing something you made with your own hands is very 
                    nice. It was knitted with a technic called <strong>topdown</strong>, 
                    very common in pieces like jumpers, coats, shirts, etc.
